+--------------+-----------------+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |

Explanation: 
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.
